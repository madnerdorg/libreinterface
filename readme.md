# LibreConnect
LibreConnect, let's you **control Arduinos** from your **browser** and create **local web interface**.    
As for now, this is just a prototype, a lot still need to be done !

LibreConnect doesn't need an internet connection or even a connection to works. 

There is 3 elements in LibreConnect

* Interface : A serverless web interface where the code is saved directly into your browser
* Connector : A python application that transform arduino into websocket.
* Devices : Arduino sketches ready to use!

# Interface
The interface, is serverless, this means you can download it and open **index.html** and it will works.        
It was made using [semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) an human-friendly development platform    
All interactions with devices are made using **websockets**
