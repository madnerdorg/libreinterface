LibreInterface, let's you **control Arduinos** from your **browser** and create **local web interface**.    
As for now, this is just a proof of concept, a lot still need to be done !   

* LibreInterface doesn't need an **internet connection** or even a **connection** to works.

* All changes are saved **inside your browser** using localStorage.
* Integrated **code editor**

* **Load/Save** your interface as a **json file** and share it!

# Interface
The interface, is **serverless**, this means you can download it and open **index.html** and it will works.        
It was made using [semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) an human-friendly development platform    
All interactions with devices are made using **websockets**    
All interface code are saved inside the localStorage of your browser, which means you can customize
your interface.
